This application allows users to view a map of NSW with each measure visualised in colour. To assist with managing memory, measures have been grouped into categories which can be selected using the drop down on the next tab. The map will then generate,<b> but please be patient as this can take up to 1 minute each time the drop down is used.</b>

Full code can be found here: <https://github.com/RohanDanisCox/ilab_2019/>

My blog describing my progress throught iLab 2019 and building these apps is available here: <https://16-3327.ca.uts.edu.au/ilab-1-2019/>

This application is one of three I have built for my iLab 2019 project. The other two are:

* A suburb investigation app which allows users to look closely at a given suburb and inspect variables. Find it here: <https://rohandaniscox.shinyapps.io/suburb_investigation_app/>
* A suburb comparison app which allows users to investigate suburbs in 2019 which are similar to either a set of inputs or another suburb. Find it here: <https://rohandaniscox.shinyapps.io/similarity_app/>

This application makes use of the Leaflet mapping package and combines data from the following sources:
