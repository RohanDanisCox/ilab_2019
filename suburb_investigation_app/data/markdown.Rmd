This application allows users to navigate through suburbs in NSW and investigate qualities measured on each suburb. 

Up to 3 suburbs can be selected, start typing the name of the suburb to see a shortened list.

The display includes: 

* An interactive map showing each of the suburbs selected, highlighted in red.

* A line graph showing the change over time in the selected variable.

* A density graph showing the full distribution for the selected variable across NSW. The vertical lines indicate years of the selected suburb within that distribution.

Full code can be found here: <https://github.com/RohanDanisCox/ilab_2019/>

My blog describing the activities take is availabel here: <https://16-3327.ca.uts.edu.au/ilab-1-2019/>

This application is one of three I have built for my iLab 2019 project. The other two are:

* A map-based variable investigation app using Leaflet, which allows users to visualise groupings of variables across all of NSW. Find it here: <https://rohandaniscox.shinyapps.io/leaflet_investigation_app/>
* A suburb comparison app which allows users to investigate which suburbs in 2019 are similar in characteristics to other suburbs in past years. Find it here: <https://rohandaniscox.shinyapps.io/similarity_app/>

This application makes use of the Leaflet mapping package and combines data from the following sources:
