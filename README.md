# iLab 2019 - NSW Property 

For my UTS iLab course I have produced a series of property related applications which allow users to investigate NSW suburbs and uncover stories within the data. The applications are hosted on shinyapps.io with links available on my GitHub site: https://rohandaniscox.github.io/ilab_2019/ 

Please contact me on LinkedIn if you have any questions or feedback.
